\usage{
glmm(
  formula,
  data = NULL,
  family = "binomial",
  covar = NULL,
  offset = NULL,
  optim_options = optimControl(),
  adapt_RW_options = adaptControl(),
  trace = 0,
  tuning_options = lambdaControl(),
  progress = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{a two-sided linear formula object describing both the fixed effects and 
random effects part of the model, with the response on the left of a ~ operator and the terms, 
sepearated by + operators, on the right. Random-effects terms are distinguished by vertical bars 
("|") separating expression for design matrices from the grouping factor. \code{formula} should be 
of the same format needed for \code{\link[lme4]{glmer}} in package \pkg{lme4}. Only one grouping factor 
will be recognized. The random effects covariates need to be a subset of the fixed effects covariates.
The offset must be specified outside of the formula in the 'offset' argument.}

\item{data}{an optional data frame containing the variables named in \code{formula}. If \code{data} is 
omitted, variables will be taken from the environment of \code{formula}.}

\item{family}{a description of the error distribution and link function to be used in the model. 
Currently, the \code{glmmPen} algorithm allows the binomial, gaussian, and poisson families
with canonical links only.}

\item{covar}{character string specifying whether the covariance matrix should be unstructured
("unstructured") or diagonal with no covariances between variables ("independent").
Default is set to \code{NULL}. If \code{covar} is set to \code{NULL} and the number of random effects
predictors (not including the intercept) is 
greater than or equal to 10 (i.e. high dimensional), then the algorithm automatically assumes an 
independent covariance structure and \code{covar} is set to "independent". Otherwise if \code{covar}
is set to \code{NULL} and the number of random effects predictors is less than 10, then the
algorithm automatically assumes an unstructured covariance structure and \code{covar} is set to "unstructured".}

\item{offset}{This can be used to specify an \emph{a priori} known component to be included in the 
linear predictor during fitting. Default set to \code{NULL} (no offset). If the data 
argument is \code{NULL}, this should be a numeric vector of length equal to the 
number of cases (the response). If the data argument specifies a data.frame, the offset
argument should specify the name of a column in the data.frame.}

\item{optim_options}{a structure of class "optimControl" created 
from function \code{\link{optimControl}} that specifies optimization parameters. See the 
documentation for \code{\link{optimControl}} for more details on defaults.}

\item{adapt_RW_options}{a list of class "adaptControl" from function \code{\link{adaptControl}} 
containing the control parameters for the adaptive random walk Metropolis-within-Gibbs procedure. 
Ignored if \code{\link{optimControl}} parameter \code{sampler} is set to "stan" (default) or "independence".}

\item{trace}{an integer specifying print output to include as function runs. Default value is 0. 
See Details for more information about output provided when trace = 0, 1, or 2.}

\item{tuning_options}{a list of class selectControl or lambdaControl resulting from 
\code{\link{selectControl}} or \code{\link{lambdaControl}} containing additional control parameters.
When function \code{glmm} is used,the algorithm may be run using one specific set of
penalty parameters \code{lambda0} and \code{lambda1} by specifying such values in \code{lambdaControl()}. 
The default for \code{glmm} is to run the model fit with no penalization (\code{lambda0} = \code{lambda1} = 0).
When function \code{glmmPen} is run, \code{tuning_options} is specified usig \code{selectControl{}}. 
See the \code{\link{lambdaControl}} and \code{\link{selectControl}} documentation for further details.}

\item{progress}{a logical value indicating if additional output should be given showing the
progress of the fit procedure. If \code{TRUE}, such output includes iteration-level information
for the fit procedure (iteration number EM_iter,
number of MCMC draws nMC, average Euclidean distance between current coefficients and coefficients
from t--defined in \code{\link{optimControl}}--iterations back EM_conv, 
and number of non-zero fixed and random effects
including the intercept). Additionally, \code{progress = TRUE}
gives some other information regarding the progress of the variable selection 
procedure, including the model selection criteria and log-likelihood estimates
for each model fit.
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{additional arguments that could be passed into \code{glmmPen}. See \code{\link{glmmPen}}
for further details.}
}
\value{
A reference class object of class \code{\link{pglmmObj}} for which many methods are 
available (e.g. \code{methods(class = "pglmmObj")})
}
\description{
\code{glmm} is used to fit a single generalized mixed model via Monte Carlo 
Expectation Conditional Minimization (MCECM). Unlike \code{glmmPen}, no model selection 
is performed.
}
\details{
The \code{glmm} function can be used to fit a single generalized mixed model.
While this approach is meant to be used in the case where the user knows which
covariates belong in the fixed and random effects and no penalization is required, one is
allowed to specify non-zero fixed and random effects penalites using \code{\link{lambdaControl}}
and the (...) arguments. The (...) allow for specification of penalty-related arguments; see
\code{\link{glmmPen}} for details. For a high dimensional situation, the user may want to fit a 
full model using a small penalty for the fixed and random effects and save the posterior
draws from this full model for use in any BIC-ICQ calculations during selection within \code{glmmPen}. 
Specifying a file name in the 'BICq_posterior' argument will save the posterior draws from the 
\code{glmm} model into a big.matrix with this file name, see the Details section of 
\code{\link{glmmPen}} for additional details.
